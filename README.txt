Instructions

To use the program, you can either use the classes in the Precompiled 
Classes folder, or you can compile the program yourself.

To run the precompiled program, cd to the Precompiled Classes folder and 
type 'java EmailSender'

You can manually edit the contacts.txt with a text editor to add contacts, 
if you follow the formatting. Otherwise, you can use the GUI interface to 
add a contact.

In order to use the EmailSender, you will need to add two things to your 
classpath. They are included in the Classpath folder. To set the classpath 
in Linux, run the command 'export set 
CLASSPATH=/path/to/activation.jar:.:/path/to/mail.jar:.'
